The Platform is expected to use many existing libraries
Comma.ai - 
RISC-V GNU Tool Chain https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain
Iliad - Processor Architecture for Self-Driving car automotive system
Capablanca - Risc-V Superscalar Architecture
Nepa - Neuro Processor Architecture
Verilator - Verilog Simultion Tool

# Hotz One SoC

The Hotz processor will be the open source part that will be in silicon.

## [Iliad Processor](https://github.com/varaujokilby/Iliad)

[Iliad](https://github.com/varaujokilby/Iliad) is a RISC-V processor designed for high performance automative area, it is based on [Capablanca Open Project](https://github.com/varaujokilby/Capablanca) which is a high performance RISC-V project, adding structure for cars and automonous driving compliance.

The goal is that Iliad processor will evolve in architecture performance, addition of features, integration with 


## [Nepa](https://github.com/varaujokilby/Nepa) - Neural Processing Unit

[Nepa](https://github.com/varaujokilby/Nepa) is an architecture that is planned to work as a coprocessor 
A co-processor is necessary for having the neural network processing as fast as high performance algorithms.


# Documentation

Currently the documentation is mainly kept in shared Google Doc files.
Mainly we have the project proposal that tries to show a detailed plan for the project
