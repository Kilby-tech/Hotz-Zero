## Iliad Processor

Iliad is a RISC-V processor designed for high performance automative area and is inspeided on existing open source.

The goal is that Iliad processor will evolve in architecture performance, addition of features, integration with 


## Neural Processing Unit

A co-processor is necessary for having the neural network processing as fast as high performance algorithms.

# Documentation

Currently the documentation is mainly kept in shared Google Doc files.
Mainly we have the project proposal that tries to show a detailed plan for the project
